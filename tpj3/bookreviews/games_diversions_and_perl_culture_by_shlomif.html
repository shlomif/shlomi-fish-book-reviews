                <p>
                The title of the book is a bit misleading. There is little
                about games, and a large part of it was the Perl knowledge 
                quizes, and Perl obfuscated code contests which I decided to 
                avoid. There is also not too much about Perl culture. A large
                part of the book is devoted to other things such as 
                language programming in Perl.
                </p>
                <p>
                Nevertheless, this book contains a great deal of interesting
                articles, collected from the Perl Journal. Some articles I liked
                include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    An essay by Larry Wall "Wherefore Art, Thou", that tries
                    to find the musical equivalents of various programming 
                    angauges and concludes that Perl is akin to Cartoon music.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    "The Perl Journal Cover Art" which covers the covers (pun
                    intended) of the early Perl journals. I especially liked
                    the special Java edition that featured a cup of coffee with
                    a cigarette butt inside. (and you can read some amusing 
                    comments that were received due to it)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    An article about Genetic Algorithms which is very 
                    enlightening.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    An article about the IRC Infobots.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    An article by Damian Conway about his sophisticated text 
                    autoformatting module.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    An article about the Rezrov Infocom game interperter,
                    used to run legacy adventure games.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                And others...
                </p>
                <p>
                To sum up: a good book that any experienced Perl programmer
                will find many things interesting in.
                </p>
