This is a nice book that covers many advanced techniques for writing Perl
programs. It also discusses many caveats and gotchas of the language, and how
to avoid them.

The book is quite old and many things it discusses have changed or have been
updated since then. It is still mostly pertinent, however.

I already knew most of what the book had to say, so it did not renew too much
to me. Still, I think it can be very suitable for Perl programmers who are
relatively beginning in the language.

The style of the book is light and enjoyable which makes for a nice reading.
