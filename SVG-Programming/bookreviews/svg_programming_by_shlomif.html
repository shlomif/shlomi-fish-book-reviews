                <p>
                I received this book as a present from the publisher in the 
                <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2003/">latest Perl 
                    conference in Israel</a>. After reading it almost 
                completely, I can say, that I think very highly of it. This
                book provides a good introduction to SVG (Scalable Vector 
                Graphics), and I believe will also serve as a handy reference.
                </p>
                <p>
                The author's style is simple and captivating, and I enjoyed
                reading the book very much. The book is annonated with many
                examples that contain code and output, so it demonstrates
                the concepts that are introduced very well too.
                </p>
                <p>
                All in all, a great buy, if you're interested in learning
                how to write SVG images.
                </p>
