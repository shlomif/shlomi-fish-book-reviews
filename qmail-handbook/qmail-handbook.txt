This is a very good book about installing, managing and using 
[qmail http://www.qmail.org/] and various software that accompanies
it and interoperates with it. It covers everything there is to know
in a very detailed way, and is even moderately captivating.

I found a few typos in the book, but I was able to easily 
correct them for myself and they did not detract from an 
otherwise good book on the subject. This seems to be a general 
trend in recently published books I've seen, especially from
Apress.

In any case, this book can be a hands-on guide and a good
reference. It is highly recommended for anyone who needs to
maintain a qmail installation.
