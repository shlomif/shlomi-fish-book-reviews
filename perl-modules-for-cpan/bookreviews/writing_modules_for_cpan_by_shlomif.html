                The book as a whole is written well and contains some useful
                information, especially for people who are not very
                knowledgable in the subject. The style is light and
                semi-informal which makes for a very easy and enjoyable read.
                </p>
                <p>
                The first chapter of the book introduces the reader to
                <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>
                and how to effectively use it. It is a good introduction, but
                did not renew anything to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                The second chapter covers the basics of writing Perl modules.
                I skipped this chapter because I evaluated myself as familiar
                enough with these technicalities. The third chapter covers
                some guidelines for good modules' design and implementation.
                I found this chapter very good as well, and may have
                learned a few things from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                The fourth chapter covers the technicalities of building a
                CPAN Module distribution. Here, I learned several new things
                which I did not already know, some of which will make my life
                much easier in the future. The fifth chapter covers sumitting
                the module to CPAN, which basically covered the PAUSE
                technicalities. It was also quite good, but did not renew much
                to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                The sixth chapter covers module maintenance and the seventh one
                overviews some great CPAN modules. They are both quite good.
                </p>
                <p>
                I skipped the next three chapters because they dealt with
                writing C extensions. This is due to the fact I'm now reading
                "Extending and Embedding Perl" which covers the topic more
                thoroughly. The last chapter ("CGI Application Modules
                for CPAN") introduces the reader to the CGI::Application module
                and how to effectively use it. It was good, and I finally,
                understood what CGI::Application was all about.
                </p>
                <p>
                I was a bit disappointed by the book, because I expected to
                find some very high wisdom on writing CPAN modules. But I
                guess no such thing exists besides what the book covers, and
                so the entry level to becoming a good CPAN contributor is
                lower. So, all in all, a great book.
